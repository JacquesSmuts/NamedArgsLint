# NamedArgsLint
Adds lint-warnings if a function or constructor is called without named arguments

## Usage
Add this to your dependencies in the modules build.gradle. It will provide warnings if you don't use named arguments.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.jacquessmuts.namedargslinter:{version}'
}
```

Adding this check will generate a lint warning whenever you pass more than 1 argument to a function or constructor without using named arguments.

## Work in progress

This is a work in progress, as the lint-checks are being done very badly right now. I don't really recommend you use it until version 0.2.0 or so comes out, then I'll remove this section.
